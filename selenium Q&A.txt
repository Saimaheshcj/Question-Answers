1) What is Selenium? What are the different Selenium components? Explain about Selenium Webdriver.
Ans: Selenium is an automation testing tool used to test web-based applications. 
     Selenium is not a single tool but a suite of tools. 
  There are four components of Selenium â€“ Selenium IDE, RC, WebDriver, and Grid. The last two are the most famous ones.

2) How does Selenium communicate with the Web browsers?
Ans:>>WebDriverManager.window().setup();
     initially Downloads the driver and set up the path
    >>ChromeDriver driver=new ChromeDriver();
    then launch the Web browser according to which browser drivr we have used.

3) What are the locators available to find an element using Selenium?
Ans: The locators in selenium 
     ->id
     ->classname
     ->linktext
     ->partial link
     ->name
     ->xpath
     ->attribute

4) Why ID is preferable than X-Path?
Ans: Fast: Locating with ID is faster than xpath; as with xpath, locating element involved traversing through the DOM
     IDs are unique

5) How to select value in dropdown?
Ans:>> Import the package org.openqa.selenium.support.ui.Select
    >> Instantiate the drop-down box as an object, Select in Selenium WebElement
    >> create an object ;
    >> select d1 =new select();
    >> now use that objects
    >> 3 locators canbe use in dropdown  1.byindex 2.byvisibleindex 3.byvalue.d1.selectbyindex();

6) What is the difference between Absolute Path and Relative Path?
Ans: Absolute XPath begins from the root of the beginner
     but relative XPath begins from the grandparent tag. parent tag. child tag.

7) How to verify if the given check box is checked or not (it is not taught but you can explore) Try here: http://leafground.com/pages/checkbox.html
Ans: objectname.findelement(by.locator).is selected();
     The return type is boolean if checked its shows true  if not false

8)Difference between System.setProperty and WebDriverManager
Ans: WebDrivermanager=download the driver and setup the path
    system.setproperty=to configure the browser to drive the path


9) Write the syntax for preceding and following x-paths.
Ans://Eldersibling xpath/following-sibling::youngsibling tagname/xpath
    //youngsibling xpath/following-sibling::Eldersibling tagname/xpath

    //parent xpath/following child tagname/xpath
    //chid xpath/following parent tagname/xpath

10) How to get an attribute value using Selenium WebDriver?
Ans: To get the attribute value using selenium webdriver, we can use 'element. getAttribute(attributeName)'.
    If we try to get the attribute value that doesn't exist for the tag, it will return a null value
   object name.find element.(by.locators).getattribute("value");
print the value entered in the console.
